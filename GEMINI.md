# Project Overview

This is a Unity project, identified as a "Git practice repository." It appears to be a small game or application. The project utilizes various Unity packages including the Universal Render Pipeline (URP), Input System, and Visual Scripting.

## Building and Running

Unity projects are primarily managed and executed within the Unity Editor.

1.  **Open in Unity Editor:** Open the project directory (`E:\GitHub2\Unity_Tutorial_6th_2D2\HelloWorld`) using Unity Editor version `6000.0.60f1` or a compatible version.
2.  **Run Scenes:** Within the Unity Editor, navigate to the `Assets/Scenes` folder. Open a desired scene (e.g., `Assets/Scenes/HelloWorld.unity` or `Assets/Scenes/SampleScene.unity`) and press the "Play" button in the editor to run the project.
3.  **Build Project:** To create a standalone application, use the Unity Editor's menu: "File > Build Settings..." to configure and build the project for your target platform.

## Development Conventions

Based on the `Assets/Script/GameManager.cs` file, the project follows standard Unity C# scripting conventions, such as using `MonoBehaviour` lifecycle methods (`Start()`, `Update()`) and `Debug.Log` for console output. More specific coding styles or architectural patterns would require a deeper analysis of the codebase.
